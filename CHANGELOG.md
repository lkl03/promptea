## v1.1.2 — 2026-05-31

### Fixed
- Removed an internal SEO/developer note ("To speed up indexing") from the public Guides page; moved into a code comment.
- Improved modal and popover accessibility: all dialogs now trap Tab/Shift+Tab focus, return focus to the trigger on close, and Escape closes them reliably.
- Fixed unclear enabled/disabled visual states in the analyzer form — the Analyze button now shows clearly reduced opacity when incomplete and full contrast when ready.
- Improved selected prompt type contrast in both light and dark themes; active pill now uses a solid filled background with contrasting text.
- Improved footer accessibility: removed literal `|` pipe separators (now replaced with CSS gap), added a proper `<nav>` landmark, and fixed copyright to read naturally (© year · designed and developed by eterlab).

### Improved
- Added a persistent Promptea wordmark and top navigation header across all public pages, with links to Analyzer, Prompts, Guides, Models, and Glossary. Existing language and theme toggles preserved.
- Reordered the analyzer form flow so prompt type is selected before writing or attaching files (1. Choose AI → 2. Choose type → 3. Write prompt → 4. Attach files → 5. Choose format → 6. Analyze).
- Made "How this works" more discoverable: trigger is now a visible badge/pill with copy "New? See how it works →" / "¿Nuevo? Mirá cómo funciona →".
- Moved analysis helpfulness feedback (Yes/No) below the full result content — after score, issues, recommendations, and optimized prompt — so users have seen the result before rating it.
- Added a live word and approximate token counter near the textarea that updates as users type.
- Added a "Try an example →" helper button near the textarea that prefills a useful example prompt with compatible type and model, guarding against overwriting existing text.
- Preserved analyzer form state (prompt, type, model, format) across language switches using sessionStorage.
- Added prompt count badges (e.g. "6 prompts") to prompt pack category cards.
- Added an "Open Analyzer →" / "Abrir analizador →" CTA near the breadcrumb on all prompt pack subpages.
- Improved optimized prompt output: added an explanatory note about header lines, increased max height, and added a temporary "Copied!" / "¡Copiado!" confirmation with checkmark icon on the copy button.
- Added qualitative score labels next to the quality ring: Weak/Débil (0–30), Fair/Regular (31–60), Good/Bueno (61–85), Excellent/Excelente (86–100).
- Improved Checklist/JSON segmented control: selected state uses `font-semibold` for additional non-color contrast cue; Escape/outside-click close behavior on the format explain popover improved via shared focus trap hook.
- Updated visible version from v1.1.1 to v1.1.2.
